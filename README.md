# FX trade input demo app

Small app demoing React, Mobx, Typescript, Semantic-UI-React etc.

Boilerplate code coming from https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-typescript-boilerplate

Initial run:

* Install Node.js
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* browse to localhost:3000

What I would add if I had more time?
* mocha tests
* JS validation of input form

What would have to be added if it was enterprise project?
* CSS file per component instead of single styles.css file
* some form of linting (e.g. esLint)
* etc.
